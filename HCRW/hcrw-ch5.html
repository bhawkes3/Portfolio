    <!--It appears that there aren't as many code examples in this book as there are in the Jasascript books-->

    <!-- the new video tools for HTML are relatively new -->

    <video src="https://youtu.be/CMNry4PE93Y" width="375" height="280" controls autoplay loop></video>

    <!-- now, there are a lot of moving pieces here in this code. here is a description of everything
    1. controls: allow the video box to have controls to either do full screen, or other things
    2. autoplay: means the video will play by itself when the page is loaded
    3. loop: the video will continue to play over again when it has eneded. -->


    <!-- another attribute is "poster", which is basically what shows on the viewbox before the video plays -->

    <!-- you can also make your video more accessable by putting the following sources. -->

    <source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="example.webm" type="video/webm">
    <source src="example.ogv" type="video/ogg">
