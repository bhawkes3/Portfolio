        //THIS IS DONE USING THE addEventListener Method
        document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething); //(do something being a function)
        //HERE, I WILL TEST IT'S FUNCTIONALITY. THE FUNCTION HAS BEEN DEFINED ABOVE

        //'dblclick', 'mouseup', 'mousedown', 'mouseover',

        //THIS WILL SHOW WHAT KEY WAS PRESSED
        addEventListener('keypress', (event) => console.log(`You pressed the ${event.key} character`));

        //YOU CAN ALSO USE THE FOLLOWING
        //'keydown', 'keyup', 'keypress'
        //DIFFERENT KEY___ TRACK DIFFERENT THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, A KEYPRESS COULD NOT TRACK WHEN
        //YOU HIT A SPECIAL KEY LIKE "CONTROL"

        //THIS NEXT BIT OF CODE IS PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY, BUT ALSO PRETTY NEAT!

        //THIS CODE SHOWS WHEN A USER STOPS TOUCHING THE SCREEN
        addEventListener('touchend', () => console.log('Touch stopped'));
        //THERE ARE MANY MORE!
        'touchleave', 'touchmove', 'touchenter', 'touchcancel'

        //YOU CAN USE THE PREVENT DEFAULT METHOD TO PREVENT NORMAL BEHAVIOR
        //NOTE (THIS EXAMPLES USES CODE IN THE HTML)
