    //this is my code for the chapter 12 book in Novice to Ninja


    //this "constructor function" works better than simply declaring an object literal
        const Dice = function(sides=6){
            this.sides = sides;
            this.roll = function() {
            return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
            }
            }

    //javascript also has a contructor property
            Dice.constructor 

    //This is an example of a Javascript class, and also a static method
        class Dice {
            constructor(sides=6) {
            this.sides = sides;
            }
            roll() {
            return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
            }
            static description() {
            return 'A way of choosing random numbers'
            }
            }


    //this is an example of Prototypal inheritance that I liked a lot from the book

            class Turtle {
            constructor(name) {
                this.name = name;
                this.weapon = 'hands';
            }
            sayHi() {
                return `Hi dude, my name is ${this.name}`;
            }
            attack(){
                return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!`;
            }
            }
    //now, we make a new turtle
    const leo = new Turtle('Leonardo');
    //Turtle { name: 'Leonardo' } -----commented out for an error
    //then, we call the function
    console.log(leo.name);
    console.log(leo.sayHi);
    
    //the protoype property allows you to change a class declaration after it has been created
    banana.prototype.food = "fruit";
    console.log(banana);
    
    //has own property sees whether or not the variable contains whatever is asked for
    banana.hasOwnProperty ('food');
    //the proototype will update the original class.

    //prototypes can also recieve "Inheritance", making something like a chain of prototypes
    Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(raph))

    //objects have different ways to call methods, and this is called Polymorphism. here's an example of calling a string array

    let array = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
    console.log(array.toString);

    //you can also add methods to built in objects
        Number.prototype.isEven = function() {
        return this%2 === 0;
        }
        Number.prototype.isOdd = function() {
        return this%2 === 1;
        }


    //this is not necessarily a code example, but very useful information:
    //each object properties have the following attributes
    // value ― This is the value of the property and is undefined by default
    // // writable ― This boolean value shows whether a property can be   changed or not, and is false by default
    // enumerable ― this boolean value shows whether a property will   show up when the object is displayed in a for in loop, and is false by default.
    // // configurable ― this boolean value shows whether you can delete  a property or change any of its attributes, and is false by default.

    //this is a syntax example for the information above
    Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(me,'name'); //will show
        //{ value: 'DAZ',
        //writable: true,
        //enumerable: true,
        //configurable: true }

    //this chapter also covers getters and setters
        me.age = 21;
        me.retirementAge = 65;
        Object.defineProperty(me, 'yearsToRetirement',{
        get() {
        if(this.age > this.retirementAge) { return 0; }
        else { return this.retirementAge - this.age; }
        },
        set(value) {
        this.age = this.retirementAge - value;
        return value;
        }
        });

    //you can create objects from other objects
        const Human = {
        arms: 2,
        legs: 2,
        walk() { console.log('Walking'); }
        }

    //similar to what was listed above with inheritance, objects can recieve certain attributes froma "tree" of objects. Refer to page 485 for a tree example graphic

    //along with chaining prototypes, it is very effective to chain functions together.

    //basically, in Javascript, objects are a huge part of programming. You can pretty much think of everything like an object. There are a lot of things that objects can do with each other.
